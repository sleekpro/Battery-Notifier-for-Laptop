<p>
Laptop or P.C battery charging is always a tension. We often forget to charge our laptop and seem to check the battery.<br>A battery notifier is a simple application that produces a notification message in the form of a pop-up message on the desktop. <br> With Python, we can do so with the help of psutil library and plyer library.
